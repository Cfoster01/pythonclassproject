# pythonclassproject
### Christina Foster's Project for May 2020 Python Class
This project takes a look at a couple of fabricated data sets that accurately reflect the types of data sets I use in everyday life. It analyzes the data and produces insights around how Training feedback correlates to key business metrics.

### Installation and Running
1. Clone pythonclassproject repo
2. If not already installed, install pandas, bokeh, scipy, and Jupyter Notebook using pip
3. Run Jupyter Notebooks from terminal and open the TrainingAnalysisProject.ipynb notebook to run

### Project Requirements
- Imported two CSV files into a data frame, then combined into new data frame
- Ran analyses on the data to display outputs that could be used for decision making, including surface level analyses and more in-depth statistical tests
- Added in visualizations of data to make trends easier to see and understand
